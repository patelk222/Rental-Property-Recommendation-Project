The neighborhood may be most well-known for its titular attraction, Fenway Park, home of the Boston Red Sox. However, the area is also renowned for its sprawling green space. The name Fenway refers to the neighborhood s lush parkway and tree-filled paths that wind lazily through the area, forming part of Frederick Law Olmsted s Emerald Necklace Plan (a chain of parks throughout Boston). The Fenway opened in 1876, and its route includes the Museum of Fine Arts and the Isabella Steward Gardner Museum. Fenway is filled with an abundance of students, as the area offers a convenient commute to several colleges and universities: Simmons College, Wentworth Institute of Technology, Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Science, Harvard Medical School, Berklee College of Music, Northeastern University, Wheelock College, Boston University, and Emmanuel College are all packed into Fenway. Directly across the Charles River from Fenway is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and Harvard University is two miles north of Fenway. While this neighborhood is perfect for a young demographic in search of educational opportunities, the job market is also hot for renters looking to settle down in Fenway. Of course, the crown jewel of Fenway is Fenway Park.
